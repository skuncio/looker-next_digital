<h3 style="font-weight:500;padding-top:15px;color:#76678b;">LookML Overview</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 300">LookML is a data modeling language for describing dimensions, fields, aggregates and relationships based on SQL. The Looker application uses a model written in LookML to construct SQL queries against a particular database. For an overview on the basics of LookML, visit: <a href="http://www.looker.com/docs/data-modeling/learning-lookml/what-is-lookml" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_new">What is LookML?</a></p>


<h3 style="font-weight:500;padding-top:15px;color:#76678b;">Learn to Speak Looker</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 300">Before starting to develop, it is helpful to learn the entities and parameters that are used to create LookML models, views, and fields. Learn the basics by visiting the documentation on <a href="http://www.looker.com/docs/data-modeling/learning-lookml/lookml-terms-and-concepts" style="text-decoration:underline">LookML terms and concepts</a>.You can also watch this <a href="https://vimeo.com/126865374" style="text-decoration:underline" target = "_new">short video</a> for a general overview of Looker terminology. </p>

<h3 style="font-weight:500;padding-top:15px;color:#76678b;">How Looker Generates SQL</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 300">Ultimately, LookML is an abstraction of SQL. Using the definitions for dimensions and measure in your LookML model, Looker dynamically generates SQL queries based on the fields that the user selects.

<h3 style="font-weight:500;padding-top:15px;color:#76678b;">Complete LookML Reference</h3>

<h3 style="font-weight:500;padding-top:15px;color:#76678b;">The Development Workflow</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 300">To support a multi-developer environment, Looker is integrated with Git for version control. When you are in ‘Developer Mode’, changes you make to the LookML model exist only in your account until you commit the changes, and push them to your production model. To learn more about the development workflow, see the documentation on <a href="http://www.looker.com/docs/data-modeling/getting-started/developer-concepts" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_new">developer concepts</a>. To see it in action, watch this <a href="https://vimeo.com/124354984" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_new">video</a>.</p>
