<h3 style="font-weight:500;padding-top:15px;color:#76678b;">Connect Data Source</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 300">To add a new connection, follow the instructions in the Looker documentation <a href="http://www.looker.com/docs/admin/looker-hosted" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_new">here</a>. Once you have established a connection, contact your Looker team with your availability to schedule the kickoff call. Watch this <a href="https://vimeo.com/126969450" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_new">short video</a> to see it in action. 


<h3 style="font-weight:500;padding-top:15px;color:#76678b;">The Kickoff Call</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 300">During the trial kickoff call, the Looker team will help to identify a representative use case to build out during the trial period.  In order to have this call, you must have established a connection to your database(s). During this call, you and your Looker analyst will:
<ul style="font-weight: 300">
<li>Review your database schema</li>
<li>Generate the initial LookML model</li>
<li>Identify use cases for the trial focus, including:</li>
<ul style="font-weight: 300">
<li>KPIs and business metrics</li>
<li>Critical business areas for data exploration</li>
<li>Looks, dashboards, scheduled Looks</li>
</ul>
<li>Discuss trial milestones and measurable outcomes for success</li>
<li>Cover essential principles on how to start modifying the LookML model to meet your needs</li>
<li>Schedule follow up co-development session with Looker analyst </li>

</ul>

<h3 style="font-weight:500;padding-top:15px;color:#76678b;">Develop your Looker Model</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 300">This phase is all about creating an initial Looker model. Our recommendation is that you will co-develop with us to learn first-hand how Looker works and how it would fit into your organization.  During this phase we will set up a series of check-ins where we can:
<ul style="font-weight: 300">
<li>Review any model development done by your team and make recommendations for best practices</li>
<li>Address any issues or feedback</li>
<li>Continue co-development on your model</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-weight:500;padding-top:15px;color:#76678b;">Expose and Explore your Data</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 300">This phase is all about leveraging your LookML model to begin the exploration and collaboration process. We encourage you to:
<ul style="font-weight: 300">
<li>Use Explore to ask and answer questions on your data</li>
<li>Save Looks and build dashboards that give business users an entry point into the data</li>
<li>Involve business users to interact with Looks and dashboards or learn to self-service to explore and share for themselves</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-weight:500;padding-top:15px;color:#76678b;">Trial Wrap Up</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 300">During the wrap-up phase, your Looker team will assist you in summarizing and presenting the solution and key business value to your internal stakeholders.</p>
